# CS1 glowworm
Glowworm project coded in pure C with no IDE for Computer Science 1

Objectives:
- Process command line arguments.
- Work with custom header files and multiple source files.
- Process strings in C.

Program Summary: Process command line arguments and develop logic related to dynamic processing of strings stored in command line arguments.

Note: These programs from CS1 were critical in my development of C programming skills. I encourage the reader to open the PDF file supplied in this repositiory, or any other repository labeled CS1_, and to browse through the program requirements.
